#  AlgoVisualizer++

**AlgoVisualizer++** is a menu-driven Algorithm Visualizer created in C++ that helps to understand searching, sorting, and pattern-matching algorithms through clear console output.

This project is constructive for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and for lab demonstrations.
